                                A Machine Learning Project Predicting Music Styles through Dimensionality Reduction
Objective

In the age of digital streaming, there is a growing demand to categorize and recommend music based on genres. By analyzing various musical features extracted from tracks, we can uncover their underlying patterns. In this music genre classification project, you will work with a dataset containing diverse musical features drawn from tracks across different styles.

It is important to note that while the music genre classification dataset is extensive, it is incomplete. A significant portion of the records lacks specific genre information.

Your main task is to predict the genres of these unlabeled tracks.

To achieve this, you will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality. By transforming the abundant features into principal components, you will simplify the data, making it more manageable and revealing patterns that might not be immediately visible in the raw data. The principal components you derive will serve as the foundation for the next stage of the project—applying a supervised machine learning algorithm, focusing on the well-known logistic regression technique.

Why Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?

Music tracks are complex entities with numerous inherent features, some of which may be correlated. For example, certain rhythm patterns may be common in rock and blues genres. In this machine learning project, PCA will help reduce redundancy by transforming correlated musical features into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables, or principal components. Reducing dimensionality can significantly improve the performance of classification algorithms by eliminating noise.

The features in the music genre classification dataset are designed to be intuitive and easy to understand, enabling you to focus on the core concepts of PCA and machine learning without requiring specialized audio knowledge.
